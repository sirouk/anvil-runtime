# Anvil-to-NextJS Universal Bridge - Updated Development Roadmap

## Project Mission & Rules Update

**CRITICAL:** This updated roadmap incorporates insights from studying the anvil-runtime repository (https://github.com/anvil-works/anvil-runtime). It focuses on leveraging the self-hosted Anvil App Server for protocol understanding and testing, while building a NextJS-based bridge that mimics the Anvil client runtime (using Skulpt for Python-to-JS compilation in the browser). The bridge will parse Anvil YAML app definitions, render them as React components in NextJS, and proxy all communications (WebSocket/HTTP) to the Anvil server without detection.

### Core Mission (Refined)
Create a composable NextJS project template that ingests Anvil app YAML/JSON, renders UI via React components on client/server-side, and proxies runtime communications to a self-hosted or cloud Anvil server. This allows Anvil developers to build in the cloud IDE but deploy via NextJS for enhanced customization (e.g., SEO, static generation, custom styling), optimization, and portability, while maintaining full Anvil functionality (e.g., server calls, data tables).

### Key Insights from anvil-runtime Study ✅ **COMPLETED & VALIDATED**
- **Architecture**: Anvil apps run via a Clojure/JVM server, Skulpt-based browser client, and downlink for server-client comms. Self-hosting uses `anvil-app-server` with built-in PostgreSQL for data.
- **App Structure**: Apps defined by `anvil.yaml` (config), `client_code/` (forms & modules), `server_code/` (Python), and `theme/` (styling). Forms use `form_template.yaml` for component definitions.
- **Component System**: Mixed component types - built-in containers (`ColumnPanel`, `LinearPanel`), form inputs (`TextBox`, `Button`), custom components (`form:dep_id:ComponentName`), and **Material Design** (not Material 3) theming with roles.
- **Communication Protocol**: WebSocket at `ws://host:port/_/uplink` for real-time, HTTP for requests. Session auth via uplink keys, ~30s heartbeats, and structured JSON messages with binary blob support.
- **Templates Available**: `create-anvil-app` provides `blank`, `hello-world`, and `todo-list` templates for testing and development.
- **Integration Points for Bridge**: Parse `anvil.yaml` and `form_template.yaml`, proxy WebSocket/HTTP traffic, render components as React equivalents, maintain theme system compatibility.
- **Bridge Approach**: NextJS server acts as protocol proxy; client renders dynamic components from parsed YAML structures. Focus on emulating client behavior, not reimplementing server logic.
- **✅ Foundation Validation**: Early TypeScript types, YAML parser, and WebSocket proxy development correctly anticipated the actual architecture.

### Development Rules & Guidelines (Updated)
- Follow: Discovery → Understanding → Acknowledgement → Planning → Development → Testing → Implementation.
- Use anvil-runtime for protocol reverse-engineering and local Anvil server setup.
- Test against template Anvil apps (`blank`, `hello-world`, `todo-list`) via `anvil-app-server`.
- Ensure bridge is maintainable: Modular code, TypeScript, comprehensive tests.
- No hacks; use NextJS features like API routes for proxying, React for UI virtualization.
- Document all steps; assume a team of 3-5 developers (or one ambitious one) with roles (e.g., frontend for React, backend for proxy).

### Environment & Deployment (Updated)
- Local: Self-host Anvil via anvil-app-server; NextJS dev server.
- Testing: Playwright for E2E; Jest for unit.
- Deployment: Vercel/Netlify for NextJS; Ubuntu/Docker for self-hosted Anvil server.
- PWA: Implement manifest.json and service worker in NextJS.
